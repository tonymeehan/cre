      title: Kafka broker replication mismatch
      category: message-queue-problem
      author: Prequel
      description: |
        When the configured replication factor for a Kafka topic is greater than the actual number of brokers in the cluster, Kafka repeatedly fails to assign partitions and logs replication-related errors. This results in persistent warnings or an `InvalidReplicationFactorException` when the broker tries to create internal or user-defined topics.
      cause: |
        There are not enough brokers to fulfill the specified replication factor, preventing valid partition assignments.
      impact: |
        Exceeding the available brokers with a higher replication factor can lead to failed topic creations, continuous log errors, and possible service disruption if critical internal topics (like consumer offsets or transaction state) cannot be replicated.

      mitigation: |
        - Match or lower the replication factor to the actual broker count, or scale up the Kafka cluster to accommodate the higher replication factor.
