    title: Datadog agent disabled due to missing API key
    category: observability-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - If the Datadog agent or client libraries do not detect a configured API key, they will skip sending metrics, logs, and events. This results in a silent failure of observability reporting, often visible only through startup log messages.
    cause: |
      - The environment variable `DD_API_KEY` was not set, or was set to an empty value in the container or application environment. As a result, the Datadog agent or SDK initializes in a no-op mode and skips exporting telemetry.

      - known-issue
    mitigation: |
      - Ensure that the `DD_API_KEY` environment variable is present and correctly populated in the container or deployment spec.
      - Use Kubernetes secrets or external secret stores to safely inject credentials into the runtime environment.
      - Verify that the variable is readable by the process and not masked by entrypoint logic or shell scope.
