    title: psycopg2 SSL error due to thread or forked process state
    category: database-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - Applications using psycopg2 with OpenTelemetry instrumentation or threading may fail with SSL-related errors such as "decryption failed or bad record mac". This often occurs when a database connection is created before a fork or from an unsafe thread context, causing the SSL state to become invalid.
    cause: |
      This error results from unsafe interaction between OpenSSL, process forks, and threading. psycopg2 uses libpq, which in turn uses OpenSSL. If a fork occurs after a connection is established, or if shared SSL state is accessed across threads unsafely, PostgreSQL may reject the connection with SSL-level errors.

    mitigation: |
      - Ensure all PostgreSQL connections are created after any forks (e.g., inside a worker thread or process).
      - Avoid sharing DB connections across threads or subprocesses.
      - If using uWSGI or gunicorn, configure with `--lazy-apps` or use gevent/thread-aware worker models.
      - Optionally disable OpenTelemetry DB instrumentation if it interferes with connection tracing.
