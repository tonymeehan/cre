    title: OpenTelemetry Collector exporter experiences retryable errors due to backend unavailability
    category: observability-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - The OpenTelemetry Collector may intermittently fail to export telemetry data when the backend API is unavailable or overloaded. These failures manifest as timeouts (`context deadline exceeded`) or transient HTTP 502 responses. While retry logic is typically enabled, repeated failures can introduce delay or backpressure.
    cause: |
      Exporter components (e.g., `otlphttp`, `sumologic`, `splunk_hec`, `datadog`) may encounter:
      - `context deadline exceeded`: the HTTP request took longer than the configured timeout.
      - `502 Bad Gateway`: the remote server returned a generic proxy or load balancer error.
      These issues are commonly caused by backend service instability, DNS timeouts, or networking issues in the cluster.

    mitigation: |
      - Ensure `retry_on_failure` is enabled for all exporters.
      - Tune `timeout` and `sending_queue` settings to absorb temporary backend disruptions.
      - Monitor retry counts and dropped items via Collector metrics (e.g., `exporter/send_failed_spans`).
      - Consider buffering via Kafka or persistent queues for high-reliability workloads.
