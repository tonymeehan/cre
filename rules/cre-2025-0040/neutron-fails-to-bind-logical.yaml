    title: Neutron Open Virtual Network (OVN) fails to bind logical switch due to race condition during load balancer creation
    category: networking-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - During load balancer creation or other operations involving logical router and logical switch associations, Neutron OVN may raise a `RowNotFound` exception when attempting to reference a logical switch that has just been deleted. This leads to a port binding failure and a rollback of the affected operation.
    cause: |
      - When the logical topology changes rapidly, such as a subnet being deleted concurrently with a load balancer setup, Neutron's ML2/OVN driver may try to bind to a logical switch that no longer exists in OVN NBDB. This results in `ovsdbapp.backend.ovs_idl.idlutils.RowNotFound` being raised, followed by a `MechanismDriverError`, and the port creation is rolled back.

    mitigation: |
      - Apply upstream Neutron fix (see Launchpad bug 1963921).
      - Patch Neutron to include retry logic for logical switch to load balancer associations.
      - Reduce concurrent subnet operations during load balancer provisioning.
      - Use Neutron commits with split transactions to allow partial recovery in failure cases.
