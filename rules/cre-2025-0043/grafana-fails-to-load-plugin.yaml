    title: Grafana fails to load plugin due to missing signature
    category: observability-problem
    author: Prequel
    description: |
      - Grafana may reject custom or third-party plugins at runtime if they are not digitally signed. When plugin signature validation is enabled (default since Grafana 8+), unsigned plugins are blocked and logged as validation errors during startup or plugin loading.
    cause: | 
      - Grafana enforces plugin signing to prevent tampering and supply chain attacks.
      - If a plugin such as `kentik-description-panel` lacks a valid signature or is locally built without signing, the validation step fails, and the plugin is not loaded.

    mitigation: |
      - Set `plugins.allow_unsigned_plugins = ["kentik-description-panel"]` in `grafana.ini` to explicitly allow the plugin.
      - Request a signed version from the plugin vendor or author.
      - For dev environments, set `plugins.allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = true` (not recommended for production).
      - Upgrade Grafana plugins via `grafana-cli` to receive official signed builds if available.
