    title: NATS Permissions Violation Detected
    category: authorization-problem
    author: Laurent Sibilla
    description: | 
      The NATS server has emitted an **Permission Violation** log entry, meaning
      a client attempted to publish or subscribe to a subject for which it lacks
      permission.
    cause: |
      * The client lacks publish/subscribe permissions for the subject it is
      using.
    tags:
      - nats
      - security
      - authorization
    mitigation: |
      - **Verify credentials** – confirm the `.creds`, NKey, or JWT files in
         the client deployment are correct.
      - **Check permissions** – in the server configuration (`authorization {}`)  
         or the account JWT, ensure the user/account is allowed to perform the
         attempted PUB/SUB operation.
      - **Rotate or re-issue keys/JWTs** if credentials are compromised or
         expired, and update all clients.
      - **Audit repeated failures** – turn on verbose server logs temporarily
         and review for malicious activity or configuration drift.

      - name: nats
        version: ">= 2.x"
    impact: |
      Authorization failures block affected clients from sending or receiving
      messages, which can lead to back-pressure, message loss, or broader
      service outages in systems that rely on NATS for critical messaging.
