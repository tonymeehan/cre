      title: Demo Application Crashing due to ENV Misconfiguration
      category: demo-problems
      author: Tony Meehan
      description: |
        - The author of the demo application thought it would be interesting to make the application break if a secret environment variable was not set.
      cause: |
        - It's a demo application that needs to have PANIC=off set in the environment.
      impact: |
        - The application crashes and users can no longer access the demo service.
      tags:
        - demo-problem
      mitigation: |
        Run the demo service with PANIC=off

        ```
        PANIC=off ./demo
        ```
